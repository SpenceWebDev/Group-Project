            <p>We’re a group of over 260 people from over 20 different countries. We speak at least 8 different languages and while we may not agree on everything (we’re Canadian; we’ll never agree on hockey), we stand together on what’s important. We believe in equality, we believe that everyone deserves to be treated with respect, and that when we are diverse and inclusive we are so much richer for it.</p>

                <p>We’ve partnered with Hydro-Less Laundry, an eco-certified facility in Dubai that specializes in sustainable denim production to implement a new, innovative, eco-friendly approach to making denim. The standard denim manufacturing process wastes thousands of gallons of water. Hydro-Less’ factory utilizes nano-bubble and Ozone-wash technologies to conserve water.</p>

                <p>We’re committed to using more alternative, eco-friendly materials. Soft and smooth, Lenzing TENCEL™ fibres use wood from sustainable eucalyptus plantations as their raw material. It’s a zero-waste process that uses 20x less water than regular cotton, is more durable and is completely compostable and biodegradable. Meanwhile, we’ve also increased our use of recycled polyester that uses the PET found in clear plastic bottles to create a fabric that prevents it from ending up in a landfill or the ocean.</p>

                <p>The organic cotton used for these garments is grown using methods and materials that have a low impact on the environment. Organic production systems replenish and maintain soil fertility, reduce the use of toxic and persistent pesticides and fertilizers, and build biologically diverse agriculture.</p>

            <p>Our factories provide a safe and stimulating workplace for over 48,000 people around the world. One of our goals is to always provide a positive work environment for all of our employees.
            </p>
            <p>
            All production employees at our owned facilities earn significantly more than the legally-mandated minimum industry wages in all the countries where we operate. Moreover, in the majority of our locations, our employees receive valuable competitive benefits such as 24-hour access to onsite medical clinics, free transportation to and from work, subsidized meals, and access to financial aid programs. These incentives have had a direct and positive impact on the quality of life of our employees, their families and their communities.
            </p>
            <p>  
            In the coming years, we will continue to develop initiatives that will build on our existing employee relations practices and ensure that our health and safety practices are among the best in the apparel industry. We will continue to strengthen our training and development programs with the objective of creating an increased number of advancement opportunities for our employees.</p>
